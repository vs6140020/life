Mainly consists of two java files CaesarCipher.java and Ceta.java, both based on simple encryption and decryption.
If familiar with Caesar cipher then go ahead, if not then check it first.
The CaesarCipher file just moves every alphabet the respective number of times plus or minus according to their ascii values.
and works on a file you can save it as EReport say (encrypted report) that will run and then create a new file named DReport 
in the same directory say (decrypted report).
The second file Ceta.java is the same almost except that it repeats the loop only with the lower case alphabets and repeats
the lettercase once it is exceeded and it takes the input as string not in files.
